Climate change is a controversial topic of debate, where many of us do not believe in anthropogenic climate change. Because its consequences are predicted to be dire, such as mass ocean extinction and frequent extreme weather events, it is important to learn what causes the warming in order to better combat it. This projectâ€™s main objective is to predict weather and analyze various atmospheric gases that are causing harm to global warming up until now.
